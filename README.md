# DDD-Members

ðŸš€ Welcome to the DDD-Members project! This repository showcases a comprehensive implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles using .NET Core. Dive in to explore a robust and maintainable architecture with features like CQRS, Clean Architecture, and more.

## Features

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Leverage the power of DDD to tackle complex business logic.
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain a clear separation of concerns for better scalability and maintainability.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate read and write operations for optimized performance.
- **FluentValidation**: Ensure robust input validation.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: Efficient data access and manipulation.
- **MediatR**: Simplify application logic with the mediator pattern.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging for better debugging and monitoring.
- **Unit of Work**: Manage transactions efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or any other compatible database
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ebrahem-Outlook/DDD-Members.git
   cd DDD-Members
   ```

2. **Setup the Database**:
   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your database.
   - Apply migrations to create the database schema:
     ```sh
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

### Usage

- **Endpoints**: Explore various API endpoints for managing members.
- **Swagger**: Access the Swagger UI for interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:<port>/swagger`.

## Project Structure

- **Domain**: Contains core business logic and domain models.
- **Application**: Implements application services, CQRS handlers, and validation logic.
- **Infrastructure**: Manages data access, repository implementations, and external services.
- **Presentation**: Hosts the API controllers and related presentation logic.
